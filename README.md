# BGS Technical Test

Hi there reader, I want to share my mental process for this exercise:

After reading the exercise I came to the conclusion that the MVP should be composed of the following systems/modules:
 
+ **Player controller system.**
+ **Dialogue system.**
+ **Inventory system.**
+ **Equipment system.**
+ **Shop system.**
+ **UI System.**

I quickly realized that time was of the essence and I didn't have much. I did some quick math and out of the 96 hours deadline I'd have only 15 hours to put into this project. 
So I decided to prioritize the modularity of the mechanics and the correct workflow between systems (which sadly had a huge impact on the aesthetic of the MVP).
I opted to use singletons (I’m not proud about it) since they provide flexibility to test fast, but I’d probably refactor code to avoid using them. 
I don’t think that I can explain the systems functionally in only up to 300 words but I’d love to explain them in a meeting. 
 
Regarding how well I think I did, I'm actually happy with it. Since I did not get the proper asset that I was looking for the character (meaning a properly rigged character so clothes could be easily changed by changing just the sprite from the proper sprite renderer) the "Equipment system" is quite limited and hardcoded/hacked to be functional to the exercise. I realized too late that we, argentinians, cannot use credit cards on paypal so I couldn't get the assets that I was counting on, and since I left the aesthetics/visuals for the last day I was really crushed with this situation and I had to improvise.
That being said, is a functional MVP although there is a lot of work/polish to do.
 
Cheers,
**Leandro.**
